Each connection has the following attributes:

NODENAME Unique to each node.

PATHSPEC The printf style format string for the base path, e.g.:

/home/inside/$NODENAME

If using MQTT a pub/sub request is relative to this, so a node name "fred" send "^pub TEMPERATURE" becomes

/home/inside/fred/TEMPERATURE
